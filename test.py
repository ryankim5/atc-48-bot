üöÄ Our Mission: To ensure that anyone from anywhere in the world can engage in semi-realistic ATC roleplay. With only reasonable barriers and rules in place to safeguard operations from any bad actors.

üõ©Ô∏è Our Operations: We currently operate one Private Server, with the possibility of adding more in future to cater to demand. All the information you require to get started on your journey here can be found in the category below, with ‚Å†charts, a ‚Å†guides and a comprehensive list of ‚Å†game-rules for you to look at.

**How to join:**
In order to join the game and speak in any of the channels, you must follow these two steps:

2. You must pass the theory quiz. In order to attempt the quiz, you must be in the server for a minimum of one week. (7 days) The quiz contains questions that assess your knowledge of the rules, and how our operations run. In order to begin the quiz, click the blue button at the bottom of this message.
